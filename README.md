# Tea Cozy Project

This project is a webpage for a fictional tea house called Tea Cozy.

Starting with a [*design specification*](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg) and images for background and content, the objective was to design a pixel perfect webpage that matches the specification.
